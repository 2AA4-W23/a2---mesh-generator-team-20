## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes several arguments:

- the name of the file to store the mesh
- the type of the mesh
- the width of the mesh (in px)
- the height of the mesh (in px)
- the number of sites (for the Voronoi mesh) or the size of the squares (for other meshes)
- the thickness of the segments (in px)
- the thickness of the vertices (in px)
- the number of relaxation steps (for the Voronoi mesh)

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
[//]: # (mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh)
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh [options] [width] [height] [squareSize/sitesCount] [segmentThickness] [vertexThickness] [relaxation]
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % 
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments:

- the file containing the mesh
- the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
