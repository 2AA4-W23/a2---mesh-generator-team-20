## How to run the product

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a
directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file
named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one.

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes several
arguments:

- the name of the file to store the mesh
- the type of the mesh
- the width of the mesh (in px)
- the height of the mesh (in px)
- the number of sites (for the Voronoi mesh) or the size of the squares (for other meshes)
- the thickness of the segments (in px)
- the thickness of the vertices (in px)
- the number of relaxation steps (for the Voronoi mesh only)

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
                          # run in production mode
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh [options] [width] [height] [squareSize/sitesCount] [segmentThickness] [vertexThickness] [relaxation]
                          # run in debug mode 
mosser@azrael generator % mvn -q exec:java -Denv=debug -Dexec.args="sample.mesh [options] [width] [height] [squareSize/sitesCount] [segmentThickness] [vertexThickness] [relaxation]"
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % 
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take
two arguments:

- the file containing the mesh
- the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
                           # run in production mode
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg
                           # run in debug mode
mosser@azrael visualizer % mvn -q exec:java -Denv=debug -Dexec.args="../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg"
mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```

To viualize the SVG file:

- Open it with a web browser
- Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so
that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog
### Definition of Done

definition of done for your features:

- The feature is implemented
- The feature is tested
- The feature is documented

### Step2 demonstrate:
In step2 we created several adt to produce full meshes. The user can adjust thickness, color of the grid mesh. By manually active Visualization mode, the user can view the polygons in black, centroids in red, and neighborhood relationships in light grey
